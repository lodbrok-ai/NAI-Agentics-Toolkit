# 🧠 Neurodiversity-as-Infrastructure (NAI) Toolkit

This is an open research + design repo exploring **Neurodiversity-as-Infrastructure (NAI)** — a systems-thinking approach to embedding cognitive difference into AI agentics, decentralised coordination, and LLM interaction design.

## 🔍 What's inside

- **Core NAI Principles** → How cognitive variation becomes a systems advantage
- **Agent Design** → Multi-modal agents built for disagreement, nuance, and pattern disruption
- **Prompt Library** → Prompts optimised for divergent logic, deep focus, and system mapping
- **Web3 Governance Models** → DAO frameworks inspired by neurodivergent workflows

## 📣 Who this is for
Builders, strategists, prompt engineers, DAO operators, researchers, and rebels.

## 💡 Why NAI matters
Because sameness is fragile — and difference is *infrastructure*.
